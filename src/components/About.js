                    <hr/>
                    <p>We are a collective of anarcho-capitalist scientists and business people who staunchly disagree with the concept of government and the resulting oppression that inevitably follows. As such, we conduct our business from an undisclosed location in an effort to avoid the authoritarian tendencies that infect even the most "free" countries on this planet.  Because we are free to operate without the restrictive shackles of any foreign government, we are able to bring to you a product that is truly unique, and unable to be obtained from anywhere else on earth. </p>

                                        <p>Just like Hoover's campaign slogan "A Chicken for Every Pot", we feel that "A Beast in Every House" is an admirable business slogan. We will be working tirelessly to bring you the beast that you deserve at a price you can afford.</p>

                                <p>Ok, this is a big one. Please, please, please follow the safety recommendations shipped with your beast. If we suggest not to get your beast wet or feed it after midnight... it's probably best not to get it wet or feed it after midnight. These are rules for a reason folks. </p>
